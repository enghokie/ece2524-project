Description:
This is a typing challenge game made with C. You can test or practice your typing skills with three different challenging modes and a sleek interface!  The game is user friendly and uses local time to pacingly guide you through the game. The statistics of each mode will be recorded and displayed at the end.

Directions: Run "make" in your terminal to compile the files and run the command "./typemachine" in this directory.

How To Play:
Just run the command above and the game will start. The game is running in rensponse to local time, so be patiently and let the game guide you through what to do. Only type when directed to. Enjoy!

Unix Philosophy:
There are many aspects of the unix philosophy incorporated into the design of this project. Modularity, cohesion, and KISS philosophies are some of the big players into each function. The main runs the seperate modular functions together to create the game. Each function does one thing and one thing well. The functions can be put together to build a bigger program. Error checking was another big factor since the program requires different forms of user input to continue.
